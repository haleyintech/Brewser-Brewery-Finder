# BREW-SER: A Browser for Brews üçª

Brew-ser is a brewery finder app, with functionality and use that depends on the type of user that logs in, and a retro design palette.

This application shows users a list of breweries and brewery associated beers. Users can create an account as a Beer Lover, Brewer, or Administrator.
Beer Lovers can view and add reviews for their favorite beers, while Brewers can make edits to their brewery information, & add or delete beers and reviews. Administrators have additional options including creating new breweries.

## Installation

### Backend

Create the database by running the "[create.sh](http://create.sh/)" script located in the database folder in your terminal. If the [create.sh](http://create.sh/) script fails, you can manually run each SQL query to create the databse.

```
cd <project-root>/database/
./create.sh
```

To run the backend application, open the "Java" folder in your preferred IDE, and run the "Application.java" file to start the server.

### Frontend

Install the project with npm, and then start the application with the "npm start" command.

```
  npm install
  npm start
```
